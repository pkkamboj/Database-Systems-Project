# Database Systems Term project

This is a project I worked on for my 'Database Systems' course, where, in groups of 3, we had to create a database management system for a clothing retail store in Oracle using SQL and through shell script aswell. We did little parts of the project throught the course as we learned about databases and SQL. Our tables are all normalized in 3NF. 

The shell script code on this repository is a interactive menu we created to run all drop, create, insert commands and queries in seperate files through a menu. The menu contains numbers assigned to each kind of shell script file, for example: 1) drop_tables, when that number is chosen through terminal the file containing the SQL code will run.
